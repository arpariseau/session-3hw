My sister lives in DC, when I go there, I always love to stop by the Air & Space Museum.

Especially the hangar complex. They have with all sorts of historical aircraft and even a space shuttle.

My favorite vacation I've ever had though was probably down to the Galapagos Islands.

So much cool stuff, and the snorkeling was amazing. I got to swim with a whole bunch of sea lions.
